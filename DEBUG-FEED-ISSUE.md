# üîç Debug: Why Posts Not Showing

## Quick Debug in Browser Console:

Open your app, press F12 (console), and run these:

### **1. Check if data was fetched:**
```javascript
// This will show in console logs already - look for:
// "‚úÖ Fresh feed data fetched and cached"
```

### **2. Check React state:**
Open React DevTools ‚Üí Components ‚Üí Find "Home" component ‚Üí Check state:
- `content` array - should have items
- `displayListings` array - should have items
- `loading` - should be false

### **3. Add temporary logging:**

I'll add console.log to show what's happening.

## Possible Issues:

1. **Posts fetched but mapping fails** - RLS might allow read but data is malformed
2. **Profile join fails** - Foreign key issue
3. **Content filters them out** - Some filter is removing them

Let me add debug logging to find out!
