### **Missing Import**

The `Download` icon from lucide-react was used but not imported.

### **Before:**
```typescript
import {
  TrendingUp, TrendingDown, Eye, Heart, Bookmark, DollarSign,
  Users, MapPin, Activity, PlayCircle, ShoppingCart, BarChart3, Target
} from 'lucide-react';

// Later in code:
<Download className="w-5 h-5" /> ❌ Not imported!
```

### **After:**
```typescript
import {
  TrendingUp, TrendingDown, Eye, Heart, Bookmark, DollarSign,
  Users, MapPin, Activity, PlayCircle, ShoppingCart, BarChart3, Target, Download
} from 'lucide-react';

// Later in code:
<Download className="w-5 h-5" /> ✅ Works!
```

## ✅ RESULT

**File:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
