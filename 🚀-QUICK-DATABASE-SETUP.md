# 🚀 Quick Database Setup (5 Minutes)

## Your Situation Right Now

✅ **Supabase connected** (locally and on Vercel)  
❌ **Database tables not created** (can't sign up, create content, etc.)  
🎯 **Goal:** Get all tables created so you can use the full app

---

## 📋 Quick Setup (Copy & Paste Method)

### Step 1: Go to Supabase SQL Editor
1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sjukjubqohkxqjoovqdw/sql/new
2. You should see a blank SQL editor

### Step 2: Run Each Migration File

**Copy and paste these files ONE AT A TIME into the SQL editor:**

#### 1️⃣ **First Migration** (Core tables - profiles, posts, etc.)
```
File: supabase/migrations/100_advanced_features.sql
```
- Open this file in your code editor
- Copy ALL contents (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
- Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
- Click **"Run"** button
- Wait for "Success" message

#### 2️⃣ **Second Migration** (Listings, products, marketplace)
```
File: supabase/migrations/101_ultra_advanced_listings.sql
```
- Same process: copy all → paste → run

#### 3️⃣ **Third Migration** (Auctions & Fundraisers)
```
File: supabase/migrations/106_auctions_and_fundraisers.sql
```
- Copy all → paste → run

#### 4️⃣ **Fourth Migration** (Enterprise auction system)
```
File: supabase/migrations/107_enterprise_auction_system.sql
```
- Copy all → paste → run

#### 5️⃣ **Fifth Migration** (Bookings & Reservations)
```
File: supabase/migrations/108_industry_standard_bookings_reservations.sql
```
- Copy all → paste → run

### Step 3: Verify It Worked
In Supabase dashboard:
1. Click **"Table Editor"** (left sidebar)
2. You should now see LOTS of tables:
   - `profiles`
   - `posts`
   - `content`
   - `music_posts`
   - `video_posts`
   - `advanced_events`
   - `advanced_listings`
   - `auctions`
   - `fundraisers`
   - And many more!

## ✅ After Setup - What You Can Do

Once all migrations are run:

### **Locally** (`http://localhost:3000`):
- ✅ Sign up with email
- ✅ Create posts, events, products
- ✅ Upload images and videos
- ✅ Full marketplace functionality

### **On Vercel** (your live URL):
- ✅ Same features
- ✅ Anyone can sign up
- ✅ Real user accounts
- ✅ Persistent data

## 🐛 If You Get Errors

### Error: "relation 'profiles' already exists"
**Good!** This means some tables are already there. Just continue with the next migration file.

### Error: "permission denied"
**Fix:** In Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to Settings → Database
2. Make sure you're the owner of the project

### Error: "timeout" or takes too long
**Fix:** Some files are large. They might take 30-60 seconds. Just wait.
