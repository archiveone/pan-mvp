## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS

### **The Flow:**

```
USER ACTION
    ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Track Event         │ ← AdvancedAnalyticsService
│ (view/stream/save)  │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
           ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Store in Database   │ ← Supabase tables
│ (view_analytics,    │
│  stream_analytics)  │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
           ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Display in Dashboard│ ← Real data query
│ (Total Views, etc.) │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### **Example:**

```
1. User clicks "Beach House" listing
   → trackView() called
   → Inserted into view_analytics table
   
2. User plays "Summer Vibes" song
   → startStream() called
   → Inserted into stream_analytics table
   → updateStream() called on pause/end
   
3. User saves "Paris Hotel" to collection
   → trackView() called with saved=true
   → Inserted into view_analytics table
   
4. Creator checks dashboard
   → Dashboard queries analytics tables
   → Shows: 3 views, 1 stream, 1 save
   → REAL DATA! ✅
