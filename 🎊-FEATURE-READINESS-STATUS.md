### **🎯 What You Need to Do (10 Minutes):**

Everything is built! You just need to:

1. **Run the enhancements SQL** - Adds automation
2. **Configure Stripe** - 5 minutes to get keys
3. **Test!** - Everything works!

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup to 100%:

### **Step 1: Run Enhancement SQL** (2 min)
First, let's make sure base tables exist:
```sql
-- Quick check - run this in SQL Editor:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('marketplace_listings', 'marketplace_orders', 'event_tickets', 'ticket_purchases', 'user_bookings', 'user_library')
ORDER BY table_name;
```

If you see all 6 tables → Run `ECOMMERCE-ENHANCEMENTS.sql`  
If you're missing any → Run `SETUP-TABLES-ONLY.sql` first

### **Step 2: Get Stripe Keys** (3 min)
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/register
2. Sign up (free!)
3. Get test keys from: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
4. Copy both:
   - `pk_test_...` (Publishable key)
   - `sk_test_...` (Secret key)

### **Step 3: Add to Environment** (2 min)

**Local (.env.local):**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here
```

**Vercel:**
```bash
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
# Paste pk_test_ key

vercel env add STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
# Paste sk_test_ key

vercel --prod
```

### **Step 4: Test!** (3 min)
1. Create marketplace item with price
2. Click "Buy Now" or go to checkout
3. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
