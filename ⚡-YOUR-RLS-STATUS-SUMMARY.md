Every table should have **4 policies**:

3. **UPDATE** - Users can edit their records
4. **DELETE** - Users can remove their records

Missing any = errors when users try that operation!

## ⚡ **The Fix: Run 1 SQL File**

**File**: `⚡-COMPLETE-MISSING-RLS-POLICIES.sql`

**What it does:**
- Checks each of your 22 tables
- Sees which policies are missing
- Adds the missing ones automatically
- Verifies all tables now have 4 policies

**Result**: All 22 tables will have complete RLS! ✅

## 📈 **Before & After**

### Before (Now):
```

⚠️ Incomplete: 18 tables (82%)
```

### After (Running the fix):
```
✅ Complete: 22 tables (100%)
⚠️ Incomplete: 0 tables (0%)
```

## 🚀 **What To Do**

### **Step 1**: Run the completion script
```
File: ⚡-COMPLETE-MISSING-RLS-POLICIES.sql
```
This adds missing policies to your 22 tables

### **Step 2**: Run the existing users fix (if you haven't)
```
File: ⚡-FIX-FOREIGN-KEY-ERROR.sql
```
This creates profiles for users who signed up before

### **Step 3**: Test everything

## 💡 **Why Some Tables Have More Policies**

You noticed:
- `stories` has **7 policies**
- `posts` has **5 policies**
- `profiles` has **5 policies**

**Why?** These tables have **extra** policies for special cases:

**Stories (7 policies):**
- 4 standard (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- 3 extra (public viewing, story expiration, etc.)

**Posts (5 policies):**
- 4 standard
- 1 extra (public viewing of published posts)

**Profiles (5 policies):**
- 4 standard
- 1 extra (public viewing of all profiles)

This is normal and good! More policies = finer control.

## ✅ **Bottom Line**

**What you have:**
- ✅ RLS on correct 22 tables (perfect!)
- ⚠️ But many are missing policies

**What you need:**
- Run `⚡-COMPLETE-MISSING-RLS-POLICIES.sql`

**Result:**
