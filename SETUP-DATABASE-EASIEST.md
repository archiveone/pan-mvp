## ðŸ“‹ Alternative: Run Migrations One-by-One

If you prefer the manual way, run these **in order** in Supabase SQL Editor:

### **Step 1:** Go to SQL Editor
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sjukjubqohkxqjoovqdw/sql/new

### **Step 2:** Copy-paste each file and click "Run"

**In this exact order:**

1. `supabase/migrations/100_advanced_features.sql`
2. `supabase/migrations/101_ultra_advanced_listings.sql`  
3. `supabase/migrations/106_auctions_and_fundraisers.sql`
4. `supabase/migrations/107_enterprise_auction_system.sql`
5. `supabase/migrations/108_industry_standard_bookings_reservations.sql`

**Note:** If you get "already exists" errors, that's OK! It means those tables are already there. Just continue to the next file.

## âœ… How to Know It Worked

After running migrations, go to:

- âœ… `advanced_events`
- âœ… `advanced_listings`
