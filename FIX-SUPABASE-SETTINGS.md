# 🚨 URGENT: Fix Your Supabase Settings

## The Problem
Your Supabase project has authentication restrictions that are blocking sign-ups and sign-ins.

## 🔧 STEP-BY-STEP FIX

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project: **sjukjubqohkxqjoovqdw**

### Step 2: Fix Authentication Settings
1. Click **"Authentication"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. Make these changes:

**🔴 DISABLE EMAIL CONFIRMATION:**
- Find **"Enable email confirmations"**
- **Turn it OFF** (toggle to the left)

**🔴 SET SITE URL:**
- Find **"Site URL"**
- Set it to: `http://localhost:3000`

**🔴 ADD REDIRECT URLS:**
- Find **"Redirect URLs"** or **"Additional Redirect URLs"**
- Add: `http://localhost:3000`

**🔴 DISABLE EMAIL DOMAIN RESTRICTIONS:**
- Look for **"Email Domain Restrictions"** or **"Allowed Email Domains"**
- If you see any restrictions, **remove them** or **clear the list**

### Step 3: Save Settings
- Click **"Save"** or **"Update"** button

### Step 4: Test Your App
1. Go back to: http://localhost:3000
2. Click the profile icon (👤)
3. Try signing up with your **real email address**
4. Use a strong password (6+ characters)

## 🧪 Test with Real Email

**Use your actual email address:**
- ✅ Gmail: `yourname@gmail.com`
- ✅ Yahoo: `yourname@yahoo.com`
- ✅ Outlook: `yourname@outlook.com`
- ❌ Don't use test emails like `test@test.com`

## 🔍 If Still Not Working

### Check These in Supabase:
1. **Project Status** - Make sure it's not paused
2. **Billing** - Some features require billing setup
3. **API Keys** - Make sure you're using the correct keys

### Alternative: Create New Supabase Project
If the current project has too many restrictions:
1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Update your `.env.local` with new URL and key
3. Run the `fix-rls-policies.sql` script in the new project

## ✅ Expected Result
After fixing these settings:
- ✅ Sign up works with real email
- ✅ Sign in works immediately
- ✅ No more 400/401 errors
- ✅ Profile creation succeeds
- ✅ You see the green checkmark when logged in

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?
If you're still getting errors after following these steps:
1. Take a screenshot of your Supabase Authentication Settings
2. Share what specific settings you see
3. Let me know what happens when you try to sign up

The issue is 100% in your Supabase project settings, not your code!
