# ⚠️ ANALYTICS TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

## 🔍 ERROR: "Error tracking view"

### **What It Means:**
The analytics tracking code is trying to insert data into tables that don't exist yet.

### **Why It Happens:**
Migration `104_advanced_analytics.sql` hasn't been run successfully.

---

## ✅ FIX THE ISSUE

### **Step 1: Check Which Tables Exist**

Go to: **Supabase Dashboard → Database → Tables**

Look for these tables from migration 104:
```
❓ view_analytics
❓ stream_analytics
❓ sales_analytics
❓ conversion_analytics
❓ engagement_scores
```

**If MISSING → Continue to Step 2**

---

### **Step 2: Run Migration 104 Manually**

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Go to:** SQL Editor (left sidebar)
3. **Click:** "New Query"
4. **Copy the ENTIRE contents of:**
   `supabase/migrations/104_advanced_analytics.sql`
5. **Paste** into SQL Editor
6. **Click:** "Run" (or Ctrl+Enter)

---

### **Step 3: Check for Errors**

After running, look for:

✅ **Success Messages:**
```
🚀 Advanced Analytics System Created!
📊 Stream Analytics - Track every play like Spotify
💰 Sales Analytics - Track every sale like Shopify
...
```

❌ **Error Messages:**
```
ERROR: 42P01: relation "posts" does not exist
```

If you see errors, let me know which one!

---

### **Step 4: Verify Tables Created**

Go back to: **Database → Tables**

You should now see:
```
✅ view_analytics
✅ stream_analytics
✅ sales_analytics
✅ conversion_analytics
✅ engagement_scores
```

---

### **Step 5: Test Again**

1. Reload your app: http://localhost:3000
2. Click on some content
3. Check browser console (F12)
4. Should see: `✅ View tracked successfully`

---

## 🎯 CONSOLE MESSAGES EXPLAINED

### **If Tables Don't Exist:**
```
⚠️ view_analytics table does not exist. 
Run migration 104_advanced_analytics.sql
```
**Fix:** Run migration 104 manually

### **If Permissions Issue:**
```
⚠️ Permission denied. Check RLS policies 
on view_analytics table
```
**Fix:** Migration 104 includes RLS policies. Re-run it.

### **If Success:**
```
✅ View tracked successfully
✅ Stream tracked successfully
```
**Great!** Analytics working!
