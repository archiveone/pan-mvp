## 📝 Step-by-Step Setup (15 minutes)

### 1️⃣ Run Essential SQL Files

**Then make yourself admin:**

SELECT id, name, username FROM profiles ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Then use your ID:
UPDATE profiles SET is_admin = true WHERE id = 'YOUR-ID-HERE';

UPDATE profiles 
SET is_admin = true, is_moderator = true
WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM profiles ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1);
