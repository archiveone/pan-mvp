# 🔧 Migration Error Fix - "content" table

## ❌ ERROR
```
ERROR: 42P01: relation "content" does not exist
```

## ✅ FIX APPLIED

### **Problem:**
Migration `102_verified_profiles_and_notifications.sql` was referencing a table called "content", but the correct table name is "posts".

### **Fixed Lines:**
```sql
-- Before (Wrong):
IF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM content WHERE user_id = NEW.user_id) = 1 THEN
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_award_first_post ON content;
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_award_first_post
AFTER INSERT ON content

-- After (Correct):
IF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE user_id = NEW.user_id) = 1 THEN
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_award_first_post ON posts;
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_award_first_post
AFTER INSERT ON posts
```

### **File Modified:**
`supabase/migrations/102_verified_profiles_and_notifications.sql`
